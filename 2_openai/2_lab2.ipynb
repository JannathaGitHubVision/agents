    "\n",
    "- **Goal:** Build a simple agent system that generates and sends cold sales emails.\n",
    "- **Setup:** Configure SendGrid API key, verify sender; optional certifi-based SSL fix.\n",
    "- **Agents:** Three styles (professional, engaging, concise) producing email drafts.\n",
    "- **Streaming & parallel:** Stream one agent’s output; run three agents in parallel to compare.\n",
    "- **Selection:** A picker agent chooses the single best email from the drafts.\n",
    "- **Tools:** Wrap `send_email()` with `@function_tool`; expose agents as tools to be orchestrated.\n",
    "- **Planner:** A Sales Manager agent uses tools to generate, evaluate, and send exactly one email.\n",
    "- **Handoffs:** An Email Manager agent (handoff) writes a subject, converts body to HTML, and sends via `send_html_email`.\n",
    "- **Tracing:** Inspect orchestration and tool usage in OpenAI Traces.\n",
    "- **Troubleshooting:** Check spam folder; fix SSL via `certifi` if needed; consider alternative send implementations.\n",

    "This notebook demonstrates agent workflows, tools, handoffs, and practical email delivery end-to-end."
